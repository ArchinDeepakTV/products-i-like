<!--! Ways to make: -->
<!--^ Make an EC2 instance on AWS and start it on Ubuntu. -->
<!--^ Load nodejs and postgres on to the EC2 instance and then use github pages to host the frontend. -->
<!--^ Or search for some other site to host the frontend part. EXAMPLE : NETLIFY -->
<!--^ For increasing the speed from the db, we will be using postgres on the AWS instance. -->
<!--^ I think getting data from mongo is too slow for my liking -->

<!-- * BACKEND : AWS EC2 Instance ( NODEJS + POSTGRES) -->
<!-- * FRONTEND : GITHUB PAGES OR NETLIFY ( REACT ) -->

Talking about scraping using python.
We can categorize the products as tech or not tech. and the further sub categorize the items.
if tech, we will scrape tech sites like beebom or 9to5google or 9to5apple or something else.
if not tech, then depending on what the sub-category is, will have to make separate functions for scraping
